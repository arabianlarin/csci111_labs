  Originally a settlement on the caravan route from Central Asia to China, Shymkent dates back at least to the 12th century and was more than once destroyed by nomad attacks. After becoming part of the khanate of Kokand in the early 19th century, it was captured by the Russians in 1864. A pharmaceutical (santonin) works was constructed there in 1885.
